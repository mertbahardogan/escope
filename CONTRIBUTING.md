## Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct that ensures a welcoming environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- Git
- Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/escope.git
   cd escope
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mertbahardogan/escope.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make tidy
   ```

5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-description

# Or for documentation
git checkout -b docs/your-doc-update
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

**Before submitting any changes, you MUST run the test suite:**

```bash
# Run all command tests
make test-commands

# Run code formatting
make fmt

# Run linting (if golangci-lint is installed)
make lint
```

**The `make test-commands` is mandatory** - it tests all CLI commands and ensures nothing is broken.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new node distribution analysis command

- Add node dist command to show shard distribution
- Include balance analysis with load statistics
- Update README with new command examples"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feat/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Run all tests**: `make test-commands`
2. **Check code formatting**: `make fmt`
3. **Verify documentation**: Update README.md if needed
4. **Test manually**: Test your changes with real Elasticsearch cluster

### Pull Request Template

When creating a PR, include:

1. **Description**: What changes were made and why
2. **Testing**: How you tested the changes
3. **Screenshots**: If UI changes were made
4. **Breaking Changes**: Any breaking changes (if applicable)
5. **Checklist**: Complete the PR checklist
